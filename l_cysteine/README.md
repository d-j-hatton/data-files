### First 15 images of each of four sweeps of a multiple-sweep rotation data set.

These files are already hosted (in .cbf.gz compressed format) at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.51405.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51405).
Until dials/data can handle compressed data, these image files are to be retained uncompressed in
dials/data-files as a stop-gap.

The images have an oscillation of 0.1°, so each sweep is a 1.5° wedge.
